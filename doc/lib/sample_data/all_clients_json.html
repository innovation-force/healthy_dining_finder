food since 1979, the Broken Yolk Café is a favorite among local San Diegans
and hungry visitors alike. With a strong dedication to good food and
equally good service, the Broken Yolk has built a reputation for its large
menu, ample portions and freshly-made flavor.  Real shredded hash browns -
not dehydrated potatoes.  Salsa made fresh daily - never from a can or
jar.rnWith over thirteen different omelets plus a large variety of
breakfast favorites including pancakes, waffles and French toast, Broken
Yolk satisfies even the heartiest of diners - all in a clean, comfortable
and casual atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rnBreakfast is served all day
long, but if it&#39;s lunch you&#39;re craving, try one of our signature
salads, juicy half-pound burgers or street taco plates. Whenever you&#39;re
hungry, Broken Yolk is your place for fresh food served every day of the
week.rn<br>Nutrition information provided by Healthy Dining<br>“,

quality of accompanying food items. Our standard menu is designed around
our signature hot pots, including vegetarian mushroom, house original,
house spicy or the combination of two (with a separator in the middle of
the pot).  The most popular dishes from our menu are thinly sliced fresh
mutton from New Zealand, hand sliced AAA beef, hand made meat balls, a wide
selection of vegetables, and some Mongolian dishes, such as lamb skewers
and oat flour cold noodles. All raw food is cooked in the stock, which is
made from free-range chicken and beef bones (or mushrooms for the
vegetarian version). Our menu also offers a selection of popular
appetizers, main dishes and desserts to complement our hot pot offerings.

traditionally characterized by casual seating on cots (called

centered on food. Real Punjabi has been influenced by the diverse culinary

neighborhood of Keystone was Keystone’s original mountain base area, and it
is a convenient location for all skiers of all abilities and ages. Set in a
thick forest of pines, it is a stunning area of Keystone. The Mountain
House neighborhood is only 200 yards from the ski lifts, located between
Keystone Village and River Run Village, at the base of Dercum Mountain. The
Argentine Lift and Peru Express provide access to the A51 Terrain Park for
a little more challenge and fun, while you also have access to the
Discovery, Poma and Magic carpets in the one of the largest learning areas
of the mountain. With a ski school and children’s center, rental shops,
retail shops, dining, youth zone with arcade, and lift ticket office,
Mountain House has everything you’ll need right there. Shuttle service is

fantastic, shorter lift lines, no waiting 10 minutes for an apres ski beer.
Sure, the place is a little older than River Run Village, but it has more
appeal to someone looking for a comfortable place to sit down and enjoy
your company. The base area has a nice BBQ joint and, of course, a pizza
place, cafe and bar. You have all of the services available to you. The
Mountain House base area is not too far from River Run &amp;mdash; only an
easy half mile walk from River Run. However, the atmosphere is quite
different. During the night, the Mountain House base area winds down at an
earlier hour than areas like River Run Village, making it perfect for
families who prefer to have the area quiet by 8pm. Close by are plenty of
restaurants and shops along US Hwy 6, including the Haywood Cafe and Snake
River Saloon, so you will still be within just a few minutes walking
distance to fine dining and fun pubs in the evening. &lt;/p&gt;“,

him, first impressions are lasting.rnPure fresh goodness is what the owner
delivers to customers on a daily basis. To maintain this freshness, owner
Ben Wang would rather purchase smaller quantities: only two cases of
produce per day to get the cream of the crop. Of course, if he purchased in
bulk, he&amp;#39;d get a much more favorable price. Yet that is not his
aim. rnThe menu features an interesting blend of American-style Chinese
food and other ethnic culinary delights. This creates a distinctive
experience that is both culturally inspired and comfortably Asian. The
ingredients that give these dishes their unique flavor are good for the
body and mind. The concept of healthy dining is what the owner insists on
delivering. Since they opened their doors in 2004, the chefs at Twin
Dragons haven&amp;#39;t used MSG or oil with trans fat. In general,
Wang&amp;#39;s policy is to use low-sodium soy sauce and low amounts of
salt and oil. Ben Wang insists on doing the right thing.  ”, “id”=&gt;476,

The historic NJ restaurant has a unique pub atmosphere. An elegant American

hang behind the bar in the Tap Room.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a
